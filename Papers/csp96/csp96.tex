Abstract

We outline how chemical reactions can be simulated by Molecular Dynamics,
and we apply our technique to an oscillating chemical reaction scheme;
a modified Volterra-Lotka scheme. We observe deviations from the
phenomelogical equations in the phase separating temperature region.

\section{Introduction}
The phenomenon of oscillating chemical reactions is fairly new \ie it
has been known for the last three or four decades. The development
of the theory for oscillating chemical reactions is strongly connected to 
the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and nonequilibrium 
thermodynamics. Until now oscillating chemical
reactions have experimentally been investigated macroscopicly and
the theory used for describing the reactions is
phenomelogical. Experimentally stu\-died oscillating reactions are
either external driven systems or systems allowed to relax to
equilibrium. 

On the other hand oscillating systems have been investigated
numrically as long as oscillating reactions have been known by means
of coupled differential equations in the consentrations. It is however
possible by today's computers to simulate chemical reactions in
continious space and on a molecular level by Monte-Carlo (MC) and
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. It implies that it is possible to
investigate realistic systems where also other nonlinear dynamics,
like a phase seperation might influence the chemical reaction. It was
recently shown that chemical reactions have a large effect on phase  
separation; see \eg \cite{glotzer} for a Monte-Carlo study of simple 
first-order reactions $A \rightleftarrows B$ and Molecular Dynamics study of
first- and second-order reactions \cite{tox2}. 


\section{Chemical Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics}
Chemical reactions, on a microscopic level, are usually formulated as
coupled  elementary reactions. We will here only consider coupled
bimolecular reactions \ie a reactions where there are two reactants
in each reactions. 

The usual chemical viewpoint is the transition state theory. The basic idea
is that the two reactants collide and form an activated complex ($C^{\ddag}$),
which can either break into the reactants again or into the products.
The quantum mechanical details in this reversible dynamics are,
however, believed to be of no importance for the overall kinetics of
oscillating reactions. The main feature is that the exchanges of
covalent bonds occur with a certain probability when the reactants
are separated at a short molecular distance.  
The reaction rate is typically given by an Arrhenius expression where
the rate depends exponentially on the activation energy in units of
the kinetic energy (the temperature). Experimentally, reactions
with small activation energy are difficult to follow because they are
fast. In Molecular Dynamics, however, we are in the opposite
situation. With today's computers we are able to simulate of the order
$10^{5}$ (simple) molecules in of the order ${10^{6}}$ 
time steps, which correspond to reaction times of only nanoseconds. 
For this reason the transition energy is taken to be of the order
$T$ which automatically implies that the reaction takes place on a
time scale equal to the mean collision time. Futhermore, a chemical
reaction appears in an open system, \ie without 
a conserved energy and fixed number of reactant. On the other hand a
traditional MD system consists of a fixed number of particles 
and with a well-defined Hamiltonian, which makes it to a non-trivial
task to reformulate the dynamics in open systems with chemical
reactions. The actual implementation and its impact on 
the dynamics is described in in more details in Ref.\ \cite{tox2}.
In summary the reaction dynamics is implemented into the MD 
by spontaneously  and with a certain probability, to relabel the
colliding particles. Futhermore, in order not to introduce large force
gradients into the system by this reaction dynamics we only consider 
reactions between particles with almost the same excluded volumes,
\ie the chemical individualities of the reactants are given by their
long range forces and not by their short range forces.  
This feature is certainly unrealistic from a chemical view point; but
it is believed to be of no importance for the qualitative behavior of
the chemical reaction dynamics as will be demonstrated.


\section{A particular example: MD simulations of the modified
Volterra-Lotka reaction}
We have chosen a particular oscillating system as our system. It consists of
three species and three reactions. The reactions are:

\begin{eqnarray}
  A + X &\overset{k_1}{\rightarrow}& 2X \label{Reac1} \\
  X + Y &\overset{k_2}{\rightarrow}& 2Y \label{Reac2} \\
  Y + A &\overset{k_3}{\rightarrow}& 2A \label{Reac3}
\end{eqnarray}

To minimise the number of parameters in our model, we have chosen to set $k_3$
to the same value as $k_1$.

This reaction scheme is a simple modification of the Volterra-Lotka
equation for a homogeneous (in space) oscillating reaction
\cite{lotka1} \cite{lotka2}. In 
a traditional chemical reaction experiment the system is fed by a
reactant $A$ which through a consecutive set of unimolecular reactions
is transformed into the product $B$. In our case and for
an open MD system of particles in a volume with pe\-riodi\-cal boundaries
it is, however, convenient to equal reactant and product and thus to
recover $A$ through reaction \ref{Reac3}. It is the
only modification of the traditional reaction scheme for the
oscillating reaction and the flow through the system is obtained, as
usual by only forward elementary reactions without reverse
reactions. This corresponds to that the reactant has a significant
higher (free) energy than the product.

From these three reactions, one can easily derive three phenomelogical 
equations describing the concentrations of the three species. The equations
are:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{d[A]}{dt} &=& -k_1[A][X] + k_1[A][Y] \\
  \frac{d[X]}{dt} &=& k_1[A][X] - k_2[X][Y] \\
  \frac{d[Y]}{dt} &=& k_2[X][Y] - k_1[A][Y]
\end{eqnarray*}
where $[\cdot]$ means the concentration. The phenomelogical equations are
only valid in the complete homogeneous case, which experimentally is 
realised by stirring the contents of the chemical reactor.

We have three coupled ordinary differential equations which are
impossible to find an analytical solution to. In general, we have
equations of the type:

\[
  \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \vec{f}(\vec{x})
\]

We can first find a stationary solution to the problem above \ie
find an $\vec{x}_0$ which satisfies $\vec{f}(\vec{x}_0) =
\vec{0}$. Then we can linearise the differential equation at this
stationary point and obtain

\[
  \frac{d\delta\vec{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{J}(\vec{x}_0) \delta\vec{x}
\]
where $\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix and $\delta\vec{x}$ is the
deviation from the stationary point, i.e.\ $\delta\vec{x} =
\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0$. The linearised system is a linear differential
equation. The solution of the linear differential equation is 

\[
  \delta\vec{x} = \sum_{i} \vec{e}_i e^{\omega_i t}
\]
where $\omega_i$ is the $i$th eigenvalue and $\vec{e}_i$ is basically
the $i$th eigenvector which is normalised appropriately.

The modified Volterra-Lotka scheme has a stationary solution, which is

\begin{eqnarray*}
  {[A]}_0 &=& C \left( 1-\frac{2k_1}{2k_1+k_2} \right) \\
  {[X]}_0 &=& {[Y]}_0 = \frac{C k_1}{2k_1 + k_2}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $C$ is the total concentration \ie $C = [A]+[X]+[Y]$ which is a 
constant.

We can now linearise the system and calculate the eigenvalues of the Jacobian 
matrix at the stationary point. We get

\[
  \lambda_1 = \overline{\lambda_2} 
  = \frac{C k_1 \sqrt{k_2}}{\sqrt{2k_1 + k_2}}\imath
\]
which shows us that the system will have sustained oscillations - at least
close to the steady-state solution.


\section{Simulational details}
The chemical equations for the Volterra-Lotka reaction expresses a
\textit{homogeneous} change in the concentration space of the
reactants, which for certain values of the reaction rates,
oscillate. In a real experiment it means that large concentrations of
a certain component is built up for a while and then disappears
through a chemical reaction. If the three components are miscible for
all concentrations one would expect that the dynamics might be well
described by the traditional homogeneous differential equations,
whereas a new situation appears if one of the concentrations exceeds
the critical value of solubility and a competing phase separation
takes place in the oscillating system.  For this
reason we will expect a non-trivial difference between a set of
homogeneous chemical reactions and a corresponding MD simulation.
This is due to the fact that we in an MD system can create a phase
separation by a chemical reaction, simply by ensuring that the product
has an intermolecular potential which favors phase separation. This is
ensured in the  very same manner as for the chemical reaction by
varying the long range attractions between the molecules. For details
see \eg \cite{tox3}.

The system is - as already mentioned - a three-component system. The 
interaction of particles of the same type is a Lennard-Jones potential
which is cut at $r = 2.5$. The interaction between particles of different
types is also a Lennard-Jones potential, but it is cut at $r=1.0$ 
meaning that it is replusive only. The density of the system is
$0.6$. At low enough temperature a system with such interactions will
phase separate. We use the same reaction parameters 
throughout all our simulations. The collision diameter is set to 1.0 
(in Lennard-Jones units). 
The probability of reaction is set to 
$1.0\cdot 10^{-3}$ for reactions \ref{Reac1} and \ref{Reac3} while 
for reaction \ref{Reac2} it is set to $1.1\cdot 10^{-3}$.

All our simulations are performed in the $NVT$-ensemble using a 
Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat to control the temperature and a leap-frog
algorithm to integrate the equations of motion \cite{toxvaerd}. The
chosen time step is $h = 5\cdot 10^{-4}$. Furthermore, all simulations are
done in two spatial dimensions.

\section{Results and open questions}                           
We have performed a number of simulations at different temperatures with 
either 1024 or 8192 particles. Rate
constant for a reaction usually follow Arrhenius' law \ie
$k(T) = A\cdot e^{-E_a/RT}$, 
where $E_a$ is the activation energy, $A$ is a preexponetial factor, and $R$
is the gas constant.

During our simulations we have stored instantaneous values of the 
concentrations and the number of times the three reactions has
occured. Figure \ref{FigConc} shows the concentration of $A$ versus
time for a typical simulation.
The number of
times a reaction has occured (denoted $N_R$) is proprotional to the
velocity of that reaction 
and we therefore have a simple relationship for the rate constant, namely
$k = \frac{N_R}{[J][J^{\prime}]}$,
where $J$ and $J^{\prime}$ denote the two reactants in the reaction.

\begin{figure}
  \input{Papers/csp96/osconc.tex}
  \caption{The concentration of \protect$A\protect$ versus time. The
simulation shown consists of 8192 particles and the temperature is
\protect$1.4\protect$. The time is measured in unit of time
steps.\label{FigConc}} 
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{ArrhPlot} shows the rate constant for reaction \ref{Reac1}
versus the inverse tempera\-ture. Similar plots can be made for the two
other reactions. The estimated error bars are very small. Our estimates
are that they are at 4th or 5th significant digit \cite{Blocking}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \input{Papers/csp96/arrh.tex}
  \caption{Arrhenius plot for the rate constant for reaction \ref{Reac1}.
  The lower curve is for 1024 particles and the upper one is for 8192
  particles. Note that the rate constants are not normalised according 
  to the number of particles and therefore the rate constants for the
  8192 particle simulations are 8 times larger. The dotted lines are
  the best fitted lines to the data in that particular temperature
  region.\label{ArrhPlot}}
\end{figure}

We notice there is a crossover at $T \approx 3$. The crossover seems not 
just to be a finite-size effect since we see it at simulations with 1024 and 
8192 particles.

We believe that this effect comes from the fact that the system goes from 
being phase separated to a homogeneous phase when we increase the 
temperature. In the homogeneous phase the
three reactions can occur at all places in the simulation box while below
the phase separating temperature, the reactions will mainly occur at the 
boundaries between clusters of, say, $X$ and $Y$. The critical
temperature for a similar system of a binary mixture is $T_{c} \approx
4.7$ \cite{tox3}. In the critical region the phase separation dynamics
is extremely slow; but well below this region two processes will
compete: diffusion (to the interfacial reaction zone) and
reaction. The figure shows that the activation energy in the low
temperature region is not the activation energy for the reaction but
the activation energy for combined process of diffusion and reaction.
