The pictures on the front page are snapshots from simulations of a
two-component Lennard-Jones system above and below the critical
temperature.

The thesis was produced using freeware only. The text was typeset using
\LaTeX, the graphs were produced by \texttt{GNUplot} and \texttt{ACEgr},
and the drawings were drawn in \texttt{xfig}. The final PostScript file
was processed on a pc running Linux.
