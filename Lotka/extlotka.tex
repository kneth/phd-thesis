\chapter{The Extended Lotka Scheme}
\label{chap:ExtLotka}

Oscillating chemical reactions have intrigued chemists and many others
in the last 2--3 decades. The best known example is the reaction first
investigated by Belousov \cite{Belousov58} and Zhabotinsky
\cite{Zhabotinsky64}. One can only be fascinated by seeing the
solution in the reaction vessel changing colour every minute from deep
blue to red and back to blue again.

In this chapter we will look at simulations performed on a very simple
chemical mechanism, which is able to exhibit oscillations in the
concentrations as function of time. The mechanism is simulated by
Molecular Dynamics, and it is therefore a simulation with a finite
number of particles. It should be regarded as a prototype of an
oscillating chemical reaction.

The chapter is based upon the results described in two papers by the
author of the present thesis, Eigil L.\ Pr{\ae}stgaard, and
S{\o}ren Toxv{\ae}rd \cite{Geisshirt96a, Geisshirt97a} which are enclosed
as appendix \ref{app:B} and appendix \ref{app:C}


\section{A brief outline of previous studies}
The simulation of chemical reactions by Molecular Dynamics is not a
new approach. As early as 1975, Portnow \cite{Portnow75} simulated a
simple chemical reaction by Molecular Dynamics. Portnow studied the
fluctuations in the number density of the species \ie the
concentration. The simulated particles were hard spheres.

Ortoleva and coworkers \cite{Ortoleva76} were the first
to do MD simulations of chemical instabilities more than two decades
ago. The simulated mechanics was:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  X + Y &\rightarrow& 2X \\
  X     &\rightarrow& Y  \\
  Y     &\rightarrow& X
\end{eqnarray*}

The last two reactions are introduced in order to prevent that $Y$ is
converted to $X$. Ortoleva \etal imagined that the two reactions were
radiation processes so that the system can be far from equilibrium but
without a mass flux \ie the system is energetically driven. The
individual particles were hard spheres, and Ortoleva \etal simulated
up to 450 particles.  

Boissonade \cite{Boissonade79} studied almost two decades ago the
fluctuations in the concentration in two simple mechanisms
($A+C\rightarrow X+C, 2X\rightarrow 2N$ and $A+C \rightarrow X+C, 2X
\rightarrow X+N$). The system was two-dimensional and the particles
were hard disks. The simulation results are compared with a
master-equation approach.

In 1983 Heinrichs \etal \cite{Heinrichs83} performed simulations on
another oscillating reaction. The scheme was:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  A + B &\rightarrow& C     \\
  C + B &\rightarrow& D + B \\
  D     &\rightarrow& 2 B 
\end{eqnarray*}

In order to simulate an open system, Heinrichs \etal introduced an
inflow and an outflow of particles \ie the species $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$
are created and removed randomly. Furthermore, there is an inert
species, $X$. If there are any inert species present in the system, an
$X$ particle is converted to one of the other species which mimics an
open system. If no inert species are present, a new particle is
created at a randomly chosen position. The first reaction creates an
inert particle, because the reaction really is $A+B \rightarrow
C+X$. In the third reaction a new particle (of type $B$) is
created. If the number of inert particles is larger than a certain
value, some of them are removed. All particles are hard spheres. It is
hard to tell exactly which ensemble Heinrichs \etal were simulating.

Recently, Diebner \etal \cite{Diebner95} simulated a very simple
mechanism. The mechanism is the same as we will present in section
\ref{sect:ExtLotkaMech}. The
particles interact through a long-ranged potential; basically a
repulsive Coulomb potential. The main result is that the mechanism is
oscillatory even on the microscopic level. In a very different
context, Frachebourg \etal \cite{Frachebourg96} have studied the same
mechanism as Diebner \textit{et al}.\footnote{Frachebourg \etal call the
  mechanism the cyclic Lotka-Volterra mechanism.} Moreover, Gorecki
\etal \cite{Gorecki97} have studied the same mechanism using hard
sphere Molecular Dynamics and a master equation. They conclude that the
spatial correlation functions oscillate in time, and that the
correlations are longer than for a stationary system.

Mansour \etal \cite{Mansour92} have recently written a very detailed
paper about the simulation of chemical reactions on a microscopic
level. The primary objective is to investigate complex mechanisms,
including oscillating reactions. The simulation technique is
\textit{not} Molecular Dynamics in the context of this thesis, but
is based upon Bird's algorithm \cite{Bird96} which is a numerical
solution of the Boltzmann equation. The particles considered by Mansour
\etal are hard spheres, and all reactions are binary.


To the best of our knowledge, only Toxv{\ae}rd \cite{Toxvaerd96a} has
considered reactions simulated by Molecular Dynamics in competition
with a phase transition (in that case, a spinodal decomposition). The
simulated system was a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles, and
the reaction scheme was $A \rightleftarrows B$. The result from these 
simulations is that chemical reactions have a strong influence on the
kinetics of the spinodal decomposition. In the last years an number of
papers has been published on which influence chemical reactions may
have on the phase separation process, see \eg Glotzer \etal
\cite{Glotzer94,Glotzer95}, Christensen \etal \cite{Christensen96}, and
Verdasca \etal \cite{Verdasca95}. The papers mainly investigate the
problem by modifying the Cahn-Hilliard equation to include chemical
reactions, and then solve it numerically. Recently, Carati \etal
\cite{Carati97} have contributed to the theoretical understanding by
analysing a such a Cahn-Hilliard based model. The work of Carati \etal
is mainly analytically, and their theoretical predictions have not been
be verified by \eg Molecular Dynamics simulations.


\section{The scheme}
\label{sect:ExtLotkaMech}
Lotka was one of the pioneers in the field of oscillating chemical
reactions. His work dates back to 1910s and 1920s, and his work was
purely theoretical - he himself was not convinced that oscillating
chemical reactions could occur in the real world. At the end of a paper
from 1910, Lotka wrote \cite{Lotka10}:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent No reaction is known to follow the above law [oscillatory],
and as a matter of fact the case here considered was suggested by the
consideration of matters lying outside the field of physical
chemistry.
\end{quotation}

His famous scheme from 1920 is \cite{Lotka20}:

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    A + X   &\rightarrow& 2X \\
    X + Y   &\rightarrow& 2Y \\
    Y       &\rightarrow& P
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}

The scheme above gives raise to oscillations in concentrations of $X$ and $Y$
when certain conditions are fulfilled. 

Lokta's scheme takes place in an open system; there is a constant
inflow of the species $A$ so that the concentration can be assumed to be
constant. Moreover, there is a constant outflow of the product
$P$.

Our scheme is very simple; it consists of three reactions and three
species only. We call it the extended Lotka scheme since it resembles
the Lotka scheme, and it is:


\begin{subequations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    X + Y &\overset{k_1}{\rightarrow}& 2Y \label{Reac1} \\
    Y + Z &\overset{k_2}{\rightarrow}& 2Z \label{Reac2} \\
    Z + X &\overset{k_3}{\rightarrow}& 2X \label{Reac3}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$ are the rate constants. We choose to let
the total concentration $[X]+[Y]+[Z]$ be constant and denoted $K$,
because we simulate a system where the total number of particles is
conserved. The scheme above violates the Wegschleider conditions
\cite{Diebner95}. This means that the extended Lotka scheme is
energetically driven, and the system will therefore always been far
from equilibrium.

From the reactions above, we are able to derive phenomenological
equations that describe the evolution of the concentrations. We
obtain three equations from the scheme given above:

\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:PhenoODE}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \diff{[X]}{t} &=& -k_1[X][Y] + k_3[X][Z] \label{eq:PhenoODEA} \\
    \diff{[Y]}{t} &=&  k_1[X][Y] - k_2[Y][Z] \label{eq:PhenoODEB} \\
    \diff{[Z]}{t} &=&  k_2[Y][Z] - k_3[X][Z] \label{eq:PhenoODEC}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}

The differential equations above is an initial value problem, and given
the initial values of the concentrations of the three species, the
solution is unique. We have in principle three differential equations
but since the total concentration is constant, the solution will be in
a two-dimensional subspace of the three-dimensional concentration
space spanned by $[X]$, $[Y]$ and $[Z]$. A two-dimensional ordinary
differential equation cannot have chaotic solutions; this observation
is a consequence of the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem \cite[chapter
11]{Hirsch74}.

\section{Linear stability}
\label{sect:LinStabil}
The solution of the three phenomenological equations given in the
previous section will give us the evolution of concentrations of the
three species. But it is not possible to find an analytical solution. 

Instead of an analytical solution, we are able to obtain an
approximate solution. We will apply the technique of linear stability
of stationary points. The technique is introduced in section
\ref{sect:OscReacts}.

To begin, we find the stationary point \ie a point in the
concentration space where the differential is zero \ie we wish
to solve the set of equations:

\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:StatPoint}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \diff{[X]}{t} &=& -k_1[X][Y] + k_3[X][Z] = 0 \\
    \diff{[Y]}{t} &=&  k_1[X][Y] - k_2[Y][Z] = 0 \\
    \diff{[Z]}{t} &=&  k_2[Y][Z] - k_3[X][Z] = 0
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}

Let the stationary point be denoted $(x_{ss}, y_{ss}, z_{ss})$. At the
stationary point, the condition $K=x_{ss}+y_{ss}+z_{ss}$ must be
fulfilled. Solving equation \eqref{eq:StatPoint} we obtain

\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:SteadyState}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    x_{ss} &=& \frac{Kk_2}{k_1+k_2+k_3} \\
    y_{ss} &=& \frac{Kk_3}{k_1+k_2+k_3} \\
    z_{ss} &=& \frac{Kk_1}{k_1+k_2+k_3}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}

Close to the stationary point, we can linearise the ordinary
differential equations and solve the linear equations. The
approximative solution close to the stationary point is then 

\begin{equation}
  \left(\begin{array}{c}\, [X]\\ \, [Y]\\ \, [Z]\end{array}\right)
  =   \left(\begin{array}{c} x_{ss}\\ y_{ss}\\ z_{ss}\end{array}\right)
   + \sum_i \vec{e}_i e^{\lambda_i t}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{e}_i$ is the $i$th eigenvector (scaled appropriately) and
$\lambda_i$ is the $i$th eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix. We are
only interested to see whether the extended Lotka scheme is
oscillatory, so we only calculate the eigenvalues. The extended Lotka
scheme has one zero eigenvalue and two complex conjugated which are

\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \pm \frac{K\sqrt{k_1+k_2+k_3}}{\sqrt{k_1k_2k_3}} \imath
\end{equation}

We conclude that the stationary state is stable, and the
motion (close to the stationary state) is a harmonic oscillation.

\section{Molecular details}
\label{sect:MolecDetail}
The extended Lotka mechanism as analysed in the previous sections, can
be simulated by Molecular Dynamics. In this section we discuss the
molecular details. 

The three species, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, are chosen to be atoms. The
interaction potential is the Lennard-Jones potential \ie

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LJpot}
  u_{\smbox{LJ}}(r) = 4\epsilon \left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} -
    \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right]
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the minimum of the potential (and the fundamental
energy unit), and $\sigma$ is the characteristic length. The minimum
of the potential is easily\footnote{Differentiate
  \protect$u_{\smbox{LJ}}(r)\protect$ with respect to
  \protect$r\protect$, set it equal to zero and solve with respect to
  \protect$r\protect$.} found to be $\sqrt[6]{2}\sigma$. 

We have simulated two different systems. They are:

\begin{description}
\item[System 1] All the particles are identical \ie the difference is
  only the ``colour'' of the particles. The ``colour'' represent the
  species \ie in our case there are three ``colours''. The potential
  is $u_{\smbox{I}}(r) = u_{\smbox{LJ}}(r)$.
\item[System 2] The particles of the same ``colour'' interact through
  the Lennard-Jones potential given by equation
  \eqref{eq:LJpot}. Particles of different ``colours'' \eg the $X$-$Y$
  interaction, is non-attractive. In order to simulate this, we use
  the following potential

  \begin{equation}
    u_{\smbox{II}}(r) = 
    \begin{cases}
      u_{\smbox{LJ}}(r) &\text{for $r\le \sqrt[6]{2}\sigma$} \\
      0                 &\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{description}

A system like System 2 is known to phase separate below a certain
critical temperature \cite{Laradji96,Toxvaerd95a}.

As mentioned in section \ref{sect:SimulChemReact}, the simulation of
chemical reactions requires two parameters for a binary reaction. The
first parameter is the sum of radii of two colliding particles,
$R_{\smbox{reac}}$. In most cases we set $R_{\smbox{reac}}=0.96116\sigma$
which ensures that only particles with a large relative velocity might
be counted as colliding particles. The algorithms presented in chapter
\ref{chap:NumTech} are applied, and the temperature is controlled by the
Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat.


\section{Steady and oscillatory states in the microscopic system}
In section \ref{sect:LinStabil} we found the stationary state for the
extended Lotka scheme. A stationary state is a state where the
concentrations are constant. If the phenomenological equations
\eqref{eq:PhenoODE} represent the microscopic details of the system,
the steady state given by equation \eqref{eq:SteadyState} must be
reproducible by the MD simulations. 

Consider a system where $k_1=k_2=k_3$. The steady state is then
$x_s=y_s=z_s = \frac{K}{3}$. We set up a simulation with $1/3$ of
the particles of each species. Figure \ref{fig:steady} shows the
result. From the figure it is obvious that a steady state exists for
the finite system. The fluctuations in the concentration (measured by
the particle fraction) decrease with the number of particles.

\begin{figure}

%\epsfig{file=Lotka/steady.ps,width=7.5cm,height=7.5cm}
    \input{Lotka/steady.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption[The steady state]{The particle fraction of \protect$X\protect$ versus
    time. The simulation parameters are: \protect$\rho=0.8\sigma^2\protect$,
    \protect$T=2.0\epsilon/k_B\protect\protect$,
    \protect$P_r^{(1)}=P_r^{(2)}=P_r^{(3)} = 10^{-3}\protect$, and
    \protect$R_{\smbox{reac}}=0.969116\sigma\protect$. The line with
    the large fluctuations is for a system of 1024 particles while the
    other line is for a system of 65536 particles.\label{fig:steady}}
\end{figure}

We also know from section \ref{sect:LinStabil} that the extended Lotka
scheme is oscillatory. Figure \ref{fig:osc} shows the particle fraction of
$X$. We see that the concentration of $X$ oscillates. The oscillations are
not regular but this is due to the fact that the system consists of 1024
particles only..

   that the number of particles is 1024 and $P_r^{(2)} = 1.1\cdot 10^{-3}$.
   \label{fig:osc}}
\end{figure}


\section{Phase transitions and mechanisms}
Mixtures of Lennard-Jones particles, which interact as described in
section \ref{sect:MolecDetail} (System 2) are known to phase separate,
see \eg Laradji \etal \cite{Laradji96} and Toxv{\ae}rd \etal
\cite{Toxvaerd95a}. Above a 
certain critical temperature $T_c$, the system will be homogeneous
\ie the density of each component is constant through the
system. Below the critical temperature, we will see domains of each
components. For a two-component system, the equilibrium distribution
of components is that there are two large domains consisting of
one component only. For three- and four-component systems, the
formation of domains is more complex. 

We have simulated a three-component Lennard-Jones system. It is easy
to see whether a phase separation has occurred at a given
temperature. This is done by looking a the positions of the particles
by the naked eye. Figure \ref{fig:PhaseSep} shows two examples; one
above and one below the critical temperature.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \mbox{
    \subfigure[$T < T_C$]{\epsfig{file=Lotka/conf.below.ps,width=5cm,height=5cm}}\quad
    \subfigure[$T > T_C$]{\epsfig{file=Lotka/conf.above.ps,width=5cm,height=5cm}}
  }
  \caption[Configurations below and above the critical temperature]{(a)
  shows the positions of the particles at
  temperature \protect$T=1.0\epsilon/k_B  < T_c\protect$, while the
  (b) is taken at temperature \protect$T=2.5\epsilon/k_B >
  T_c\protect$. The number of particles is 16386 and the density is
  $0.8\sigma^2$ in both cases.\label{fig:PhaseSep}}
\end{figure}

We measure the (time averaged) rate constants from the
simulations. Figure \ref{fig:Arrhenius1024} shows the Arrhenius plot
for both System 1 and 2 with 1024 particles, and System 2 with 4096
particles. It is clear that at $T_c = 1.7\epsilon/k_B$ there is a
cross-over for System 2. This is the phase separation we see. Below
$T_c$ System 2 is phase separating while above $T_c$ it behaves
essentially as System 1. 

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
%    \epsfig{file=Lotka/arrh.ps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm}

    ($+$, $N=1024$), and System 2 ($*$, $N=4096$). The density is
    $0.8\sigma^2$. The reaction parameters are \protect$P_r^{(1)} =
    P_r^{(3)} = 1.0\cdot 10^{-3}\protect$, \protect$P_r^{(2)} = 1.1\cdot
    10^{-3}\protect$, \protect$R_{\smbox{reac}} =
    0.969116\sigma\protect$.\label{fig:Arrhenius1024}} 
\end{figure}

As discussed in section \ref{sect:DiffCtrlReacts} the ratio $k/D$ must
be constant if the reaction is diffusion-controlled ($k$ is the rate
constant, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient). Figure
\ref{fig:kDratio} shows the $k/D$ ratio versus temperature for System
2. We see that above $T_c$ the ratio is - within
the statistical error - constant. This clearly indicates that the
reactions are diffusion-controlled above the critical temperature,
while below $T_c$ the mechanism is different. Below the critical temperature
the mechanism changes to a surface-driven reaction because below $T_c$
domains are formed. The domains are pure \ie they consist of one
species only. Therefore the only place where the reactions can occur
is at the boundaries of two domains.

\section{Concluding remarks}
In this chapter we have presented results from microscopic simulations
of the extended Lotka scheme. It is clearly demonstrated that the
technique of MD can be used to simulate chemical reactions.

The simulations presented in the chapter show that macroscopic
phenomena can be reproduced by microscopic simulations \eg the steady
state of a complex mechanism. We are able to probe spatial phenomena
like pattern formation from a very simple point of view which require
only few and simple assumptions.

We also see that simple theoretical considerations can be applied with
success. For example the theory of diffusion-controlled reactions can
easily be applied.

The chapter clearly demonstrates that a phase transition may alter the
underlying chemical mechanism. Lately this subject has attracted some
attention, see \eg Carati \etal \cite{Carati97}. By using MD we would be able
to investigate theoretical predictions by Carati \etal. We have performed a
few number of simulations of a simple scheme, namely
$2A \rightleftarrows A + B \rightleftarrows 2B$. Our initial simulations show
that this mechanism is able to freeze the spinodal decomposition as
predicted by Carati \etal.
