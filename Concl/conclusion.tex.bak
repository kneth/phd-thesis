\chapter{Conclusion and Discussion}
\label{chap:Conclusion}

We have in this thesis presented simulational results of two very
different systems: oscilling chemical reactions and dissipative gases.
Both systems have two things in common: they are in a non-equilibrium
state, and they have been investigated by Molecular Dynamics.

The systems studied in this thesis are ``simple''. They are simple in
the underlaying physical model, but the phenomenology is indeed not
simple. Even though the models are simple, we strongly believe that
these models are able to capture some of the phenomena seem in the Nature.

Molecular Dymanics is an invaluable tool when many-particle systems are
studied. Two special-purpose MD programs have been designed and
implemented by the author; one for Lennard-Jones particles and one for
rigid particles. The advantage of MD is that a MD program can be used
in equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations. We see Molecular
Dynamics as the link between the advanced theories and the complicated
experiments. General-purpose Molecular Dynamics programs exist but they
have an orientation toward biological problems (proteins in aquaous
solution). MD programs for simple liquids (Lennard-Jones-like
potentials) and rigid particles are typically written by the
chemist/physist who is going to use them. But no chemist can keep up with
the pace of development of computers, especially the new parallel
computers. An important project would be to implement - using modern
software engineering methods - novel algorithms on state-of-the-art
computers. Moreover, it is important to design and implement a number of
tools which can analyse data, and an easy-to-use graphical user interface
(GUI) is nowadays essential.

The rich phenomenology of dissipative gases and granular media has
surprised us. In order to be able to model granular media, we will need
macroscopic descriptions analogue to fluid mechanics and
thermodynamics. As far as we see it, Molecular Dynamics is at the
moment the only reliable method with can model granular media. The
validation of a fluid mechanics can therefore only be done with the
help from MD. 

Using Molecular Dynamics to study chemical reactions is not a new idea;
in fact it is more that two decades ago the first simulations were
performed. We have clearly demonstrated in this thesis that the
macroscopic phenomena can be reproduced in a finite system using MD. In
other words, MD is able to reproduce the macroscopic world, and even
better than that: the idea behind MD is so na\"{i}ve that it is much
easier to understand the physical model.


The interest in the interplay of (energetically driven) chemical
reactions and phase separation has in recent time increased (measured
by the number of papers per year). Almost all studies have so far been carried
out on a mesoscopic level (Hilliard-Cahn theory). Molecular Dynamics is
in this context an invaluable tool because the number of simplifying
assumptions is limited. Simulations of phase separation and chemical
reactions are computer intensive. In order to see pattern formation we
need a large number (often $5\cdot 10^5$ particles) of particles and follow the
system over long time scales. The simulations presented in this thesis
are not exhausting in the sence that they are only the begining. We
have demonstrated a phase separation is able to change the unerlaying
mechanism of chemical reactions.
